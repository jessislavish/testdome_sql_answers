An insurance company maintains records of sales made by its employees. Each employee is assigned to a state. States are grouped under regions. The following tables contain the data:

TABLE regions
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL

TABLE states
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
  regionId INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES regions(id)

TABLE employees
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
  stateId INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES states(id)

TABLE sales
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
  amount INTEGER NOT NULL
  employeeId INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES employees(id)  
Management requires a comparative region sales analysis report.

Write a query that returns:

The region name.
Average sales per employee for the region (Average sales = Total sales made for the region / Number of employees in the region).
The difference between the average sales of the region with the highest average sales, and the average sales per employee for the region (average sales to be calculated as explained above).
Employees can have multiple sales. A region with no sales should be also returned. Use 0 for average sales per employee for such a region when calculating the 2nd and the 3rd column.

See the example case for more details.

-- Example case create statement:
CREATE TABLE regions(
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE states(
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  regionId INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES regions(id)
); 

CREATE TABLE employees (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, 
  stateId INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES states(id)
);

CREATE TABLE sales (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  amount INTEGER NOT NULL,
  employeeId INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES employees(id)
);

INSERT INTO regions(id, name) VALUES(1, 'North');
INSERT INTO regions(id, name) VALUES(2, 'South');
INSERT INTO regions(id, name) VALUES(3, 'East');
INSERT INTO regions(id, name) VALUES(4, 'West');
INSERT INTO regions(id, name) VALUES(5, 'Midwest');

INSERT INTO states(id, name, regionId) VALUES(1, 'Minnesota', 1);
INSERT INTO states(id, name, regionId) VALUES(2, 'Texas', 2);
INSERT INTO states(id, name, regionId) VALUES(3, 'California', 3);
INSERT INTO states(id, name, regionId) VALUES(4, 'Columbia', 4);
INSERT INTO states(id, name, regionId) VALUES(5, 'Indiana', 5);

INSERT INTO employees(id, name, stateId) VALUES(1, 'Jaden', 1);
INSERT INTO employees(id, name, stateId) VALUES(2, 'Abby', 1);
INSERT INTO employees(id, name, stateId) VALUES(3, 'Amaya', 2);
INSERT INTO employees(id, name, stateId) VALUES(4, 'Robert', 3);
INSERT INTO employees(id, name, stateId) VALUES(5, 'Tom', 4);
INSERT INTO employees(id, name, stateId) VALUES(6, 'William', 5);

INSERT INTO sales(id, amount, employeeId) VALUES(1, 2000, 1);
INSERT INTO sales(id, amount, employeeId) VALUES(2, 3000, 2);
INSERT INTO sales(id, amount, employeeId) VALUES(3, 4000, 3);
INSERT INTO sales(id, amount, employeeId) VALUES(4, 1200, 4);
INSERT INTO sales(id, amount, employeeId) VALUES(5, 2400, 5);

-- e.g. 'Minnesota' is the only state under the 'North' region. 
-- Total sales made by employees 'Jaden' and 'Abby' for the state of 'Minnesota' is 5000 (2000 + 3000)
-- Total employees in the state of 'Minnesota' is 2
-- Average sales per employee for the 'North' region = Total sales made for the region (5000) / Total number of employees (2) = 2500
-- Difference between the average sales of the region with the highest average sales ('South'), 
-- and the average sales per employee for the region ('North') = 4000 - 2500 = 1500.
-- Similarly, no sale has been made for the only state 'Indiana' under the region 'Midwest'.
-- So the average sales per employee for the region is 0.
-- And, the difference between the average sales of the region with the highest average sales ('South'), 
-- and the average sales per employee for the region ('Midwest') = 4000 - 0 = 4000.
