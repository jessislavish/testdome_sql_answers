The following data definition defines an organization's employee hierarchy.

An employee is a manager if any other employee has their managerId set to this employee's id. That means John is a manager if at least one other employee has their managerId set to John's id.

TABLE employees
  id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY
  managerId INTEGER REFERENCES employees(id)
  name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL
Write a query that selects only the names of employees who are not managers.

See the example case for more details.

-- Example case create statement:
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  managerId INTEGER REFERENCES employees(id), 
  name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO employees(id, managerId, name) VALUES(1, NULL, 'John');
INSERT INTO employees(id, managerId, name) VALUES(2, 1, 'Mike');


ANSWERS:

select name
from employees
where id not in (select managerId from employees where managerId is not null);
